# K-Means-
  
implementing the K-Means algorithm and applying it to a given dataset
containing a set of 2-D points. You are required to implement two different strategies for choosing the
initial cluster centers and evaluate the performance of each strategy.
In part1 of this project, your task is to implement the K-Means algorithm with the first strategy
involving randomly picking the initial centers from the given samples and test your implementation on
the provided dataset, varying the number of clusters from 2 to 10. For each cluster count, compute
the final coordinates of the centroids and calculate the loss based on the objective function.
In part2 of this project, your task is to implement the K-means algorithm with a second strategy for
choosing the initial cluster centers involving randomly picking the first center and selecting the
subsequent centers based on the sample that maximizes the average distance to all previous
centers. Again, test your implementation on the provided dataset, varying the number of clusters
from 2 to 10. For each cluster count, compute the final coordinates of the centroids and calculate the
loss based on the objective function.
